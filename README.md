# Unlock Them All

>Thanks @qjebbs for his great job, I often use [Sketch Meaxure](https://github.com/qjebbs/sketch-meaxure) to export design specifications to co-workers. But there is one thing that bothers me. If a layer is locked, then it can't be measured. So I need to unlock all layers before spec export.

>It is a  huge disaster to check all layers and unlock them all. I couldn't find a plugin good enough to do the job. So I made it myself. Hope you like it.
